☐ maybe have an allocator for initial setup, used for enumerating different vk
objects. deinit the allocator after setup. we don't have to pay the perf price
of a gpa. a simple arena could work.

☐ loading resources require an allocator, but once we've copied the data to the
gpu, the allocations are freed. could we use a dedicated allocator (maybe a
scratch arena)? but are all resources for the gpu? maybe we need some in host
memory.

☐ some objects, like textures, allocate internal data specific to a renderer
backend like vulkan. this should not use the gpa, but the texture system could
be setup in a way as to initialize different pools for different backends.
